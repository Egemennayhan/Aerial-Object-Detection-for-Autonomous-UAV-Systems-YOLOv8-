# TEKNOFEST 2025 - Object Detection (Task 1)

This repository contains:
- Dataset pipeline (conversion + sanity checks)
- Training and evaluation scripts (mAP @ IoU=0.5 focus)
- Real-time inference visualization (bbox overlay + class counters)
- TEKNOFEST-compliant JSON output writer + validator (offline test mode)

Scope (current phase):
- Object Detection only (Visual Odometry will be added later as a separate module).
